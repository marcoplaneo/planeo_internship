    If you have any questions regarding the website you can just write me an e-mail or call me.
</p>
<p>
    But before I come to my contact info, I will tell you a little story.
</p>
<p>
    I started designing this website back in 1849. I did not know what it should be about, but I kept going.
</p>
<p>
    Now I have built this beautiful website everyone loves.
</p>
<p>
    So as a gift for your loving support I will give you my contact information now:
