        A relative of the thank you letter - The Annual Christmas Letter.
        Always written by mothers to other mothers each trying to boast more than the other about their and most importantly, their offsprings' achievements. For example:
        <br>
        <br>
        Dear Naomi,
        <br>
        This year has been a thoroughly successful one for the Johnstones. In January, Trevor got promoted from peasant crusher to hobo executioner, this means half the work, twice the pay and besides killing all those nasty hobos that sponge of the rest of society (he gets a bonus of £3,000,000,000 per annum as well). Zara finished Eton (all A*s) and also managed to give up that nasty coke habit. Horrington inherited another Earlship. I bought two yachts, a New York apartment (for shopping reasons of course, I can't stand that ghastly city), and 10 horses this year (the horses are just a hobby, you understand). Sarah's boyfriend got the MPship, as you've probably heard.
        <br>
        Oh and do tell us about your year
        <br>
        Lots of love,Heather.
        <br>
        PS: I also got voted No.12 in FHM's 50 over 50: sexiest women
        <br>
        <br>
        The mother on the receiving end will have a constant hope that this is followed some time later by one saying:
        <br>
        <br>
        Dear Naomi,
        <br>
        Not so good this year, Trevor in prison for BIGGEST FRAUD IN HISTORY house burnt down, Zara on the game and Sarah's boyfriend assassinated. Can't talk now; in court in half an hour.
        <br>
        From Heather.
        <br>
        <br>
        NB: This rarely happens...

                    "Dieses Jahr war für die Johnstones ein durch und durch erfolgreiches Jahr. Im Januar wurde Trevor vom Bauernbrecher zum Landstreicher-Henker befördert, das bedeutet die Hälfte der Arbeit, den doppelten Lohn und außerdem die Tötung all dieser fiesen Landstreicher, die den Rest der Gesellschaft verschlingen (er erhält außerdem einen Bonus von 3.000.000.000 Pfund pro Jahr). Zara erledigte Eton (alles A*sch) und schaffte es auch, diese fiese Koksgewohnheit aufzugeben. Horrington erbte ein weiteres Earlship. Ich habe dieses Jahr zwei Yachten, eine Wohnung in New York (natürlich aus Einkaufsgründen, ich kann diese grässliche Stadt nicht ausstehen) und zehn Pferde gekauft (die Pferde sind nur ein Hobby, verstehst du). Sarahs Freund hat das MPship bekommen, wie Sie wahrscheinlich gehört haben.\n" +
