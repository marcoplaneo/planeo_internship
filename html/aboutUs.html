<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
    A few years ago I wanted to buy a few things like a smartphone and a country.
    <br>
    But somehow you can not buy everything on one single website.
</p>
<h2>The Solution!</h2>
<p>
    So we came up with the idea of making our own website for you to buy everything on.
    <br>
    It may sound surreal and like a dream, but it's not. As long as it is a real thing you want, you can buy it here.
    <br>
    And the best part is: it does not need to be sold by someone. We're just going to sell it to you and afterward we
    will deliver it right to your door, if it is possible.
</p>
<h2>Let's go!</h2>
<p>
    So what are you waiting for and order your stuff now.
    <br>
    We are all set and ready to get your order.
