# planeo_internship

This project is for me to get to know the basics of html, css, etc.

## Documentation

In this project there is a documentation of what I have found out and learned in regard to the basics. That means common
commands as well as the most vital features.

## Website

In order to get to know the programmes I am building a website. Even though it isn't perfect, it is a beautiful website.
You should check it out sometime :)

This is what my homepage looks like right now:\
