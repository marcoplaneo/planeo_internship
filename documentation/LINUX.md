# LINUX
LINUX is an open source operating system. It can be used on devices like desktops, server and smartphones. This operating system can be customized and is used by individuals and companies.
## Terminal navigation
There are a few commands with which you can navigate within the terminal. One of them is 'pwd'. This is short for 'print working directory' and shows the directory you are currently in.\
Another command is 'ls' (short for list) and shows what is in the current directory or the directory given with the command. There is also a more detailed version which is 'll' or 'ls -l'\
It is also possible to open a folder with 'cd' (change directory). By doing that the current folder will be the one you opened. To go to the home you just have to write the command 'cd' without anything behind that.
## Files and directories
To make directories in the terminal you can use the command 'mkdir'. With this command it is also possible to set permissions or create multiple folders at once by typing the folder names in curly brackets.\
With the 'touch' command it is possible to edit the timestamps of a file. But if you create a file with this command it will be empty.\
Vi is a visual editor. With it, you can enter the command mode, which is used to take action in a file with commands and enter the insert mode, which is used to insert text into a file.\
Nano is a command line text editor. It is simple and has all the basic functions without making it confusing.
