# GIT
GIT is a programme to work on projects while giving the opportunity to work alone or with others on them. In order to have the newest version you have to 'pull' it. This only works if someone has 'pushed' another version. By 'fetching' you will always be up-to-date if there was made a change.\
It is also possible to create a branch to work on. Everything that is changed here will not change in the main branch. The branches can be merged at any time. But if the versions of the branches or pulled version differ on existing lines of the code there will be a merge conflict. To resolve one you have to know what is the correct version of the code and pick it. After that the false code will be deleted.
