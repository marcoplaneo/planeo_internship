# MARKDOWN

MARKDOWN is a 'lightweight markup language' meaning it is used to create formatted texts. With this it is possible to
have a more structured text than with a normal text editor. This can be achieved by having headings and subheadings.

## This is a subheading

### But it can get smaller too

It is also possible to have a **bold**, _cursive_ or ~~strikethrough~~ text.\

[Planeo](https://www.planeo.de/) is the company I will learn in. When clicking on the blue planeo, you will get to its
homepage.\
If you want to make a link for a topic that comes later in your file, or you refer to a topic that you already wrote on
earlier you can do that by linking the topic for example [Markdown](#markdown).

You can add tables to give a clearer structure:\
| Animal | Rating |
| :------- | :----- |
| Monkey | 5/5 |
| Duck | 4/5 |
| Mosquito | 1/5 |

It is also possible to make a block:

```
These can be used to list something as for example a sequence:
-First you unsrew it
-Then you glue it
-Lastly you screw it back together
```

Another way to do so is by numbering your points:\

1. You unscrew it
2. You glew it
3. You screw it back together

- If you have subpoints,
    - you can show them, too.

You can make `these` boxes, too, to highlight important things.\
> If you want to cite someone, it is possible, too.\
> "You can either use no " " or you can use them."
>
> â€“ At the end you can give the person who said/wrote it.
